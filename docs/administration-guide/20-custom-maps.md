## Custom Maps

By default, Metabase uses OpenStreetMaps for map visualizations, but there are a few customization options.

### Finding Map Settings

To find the map settings:

1. Click the gear icon in the upper right.
2. Select `Maps` from the navigation on the left.

### Map Tile Server

If you'd like to use a map tile server other than OpenStreetMaps, simply add the map tile server URL to the first field on the page.

### Custom Maps

Metabase also provides the option to add custom regional maps via GeoJSON. To get started, the `Add a map` button. A modal will appear. You will need to enter the name you'd like to use for the map, the URL for the GeoJSON file and the properties that you'd like to use to specify your region's identifier and display name.
